A repository filled with completed codewars challenges (kata). I currently completed over 100+ challenges and push at least 7 solutions every week.
<h2>How It's Made:</h2>
<b>Tech used:</b> Javascript
<br>

I spend time everday solving challenges.
<h2>Optimizations</h2>
As I solve more difficult problems and improve my coding skill, I am going to go back and refactor and optimize my code so it is more readable and efficient.
<h2>Lessons Learned:</h2>
Learning to code is a never ending journey because you can always get better. The endless challenges show me you can take different approaches to any problem. It is not always about solving the challenges, but you taking the initiative to improve your skill by attempting the challenge.
